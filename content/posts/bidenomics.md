### **Report: Bidenomics Is Working: The President’s Plan Grows the Economy from the Middle Out and Bottom Up—-Not the Top Down**

The White House statement and release on June 28, 2023 state that President Biden and Vice President Harris came into office with a determination to rebuild the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. They implemented a strategy called Bidenomic, which focuses on making smart public investment, promoting competition, and ensuring fair taxation for the wealthy and big corporations. Since taking office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have been implementing their economic vision. The aim of Bidenomic is to create a more equitable economy by tackling issues such as rising inequality, disinvestment from communities, and failed trickle-down policy. This report explores elements of Bidenomics by highlighting their impact and the progress made thus far.

#### **Making Smart Public Investments:**

Bidenomics emphasizes targeted public investments to attract private sector involvement. The administration has focused on rebuilding infrastructure, improving high-speed internet capacity, and modernizing ports and airports. These investments not only provide a strong foundation for economic growth but also prioritize domestic manufacturing. By requiring Made-in-America products, President Biden is fostering a resilient manufacturing base and creating jobs. Furthermore, investments in key industries like semiconductors and clean energy are bolstering American leadership, generating employment opportunities, and contributing to climate goals.

#### **Empowering and Educating Workers:**

Recognizing that shared economic growth depends on empowered workers, Bidenomics prioritizes education and worker support. The administration has significantly increased investments in registered apprenticeships, career technical education programs, and efforts to provide free universal pre-K and community college. President Biden has also advocated for workers' rights to join or form unions, leading to increased unionization and job satisfaction. The unemployment rate has fallen to record lows for historically marginalized groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and people with disabilities, demonstrating the positive impact of these policies.

#### **Promoting Competition:**

Bidenomics acknowledges that healthy competition is essential for a thriving economy. President Biden has taken measures to increase competition across sectors, benefiting consumers and workers alike. The administration has prioritized antitrust enforcement, resulting in lower prices and increased market transparency. By enabling the sale of hearing aids over-the-counter, lowering prescription drug costs, and fighting against hidden fees and noncompete agreements, President Biden has championed fair competition, driving down costs and empowering consumers.

#### **Ensuring Fair Taxation and Deficit Reduction:**

President Biden's approach to fiscal responsibility stands in contrast to previous administrations. He has emphasized the importance of fair taxation and reducing the deficit. By making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, closing loopholes, and cutting wasteful spending, the administration has achieved significant deficit reduction. Moreover, the Bidenomics strategy includes tax cuts for working families, particularly through the expansion of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. These measures prioritize supporting hard-working individuals and families while reducing income inequality.

#### **Conclusion:**

President Biden's implementation of Bidenomics has already shown promising results. Through targeted public investments, empowerment of workers, promotion of competition, and fair taxation policies, the administration has stimulated economic growth, created jobs, and lowered costs for consumers. The reduction in unemployment rates for historically marginalized groups and the increase in job satisfaction further highlight the positive impact of Bidenomics. As the administration continues to build an economy that works for working families, the progress made thus far provides an optimistic outlook for a more equitable and prosperous future under President Biden's leadership.
